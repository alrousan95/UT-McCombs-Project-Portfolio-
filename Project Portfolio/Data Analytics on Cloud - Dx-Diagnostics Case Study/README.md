Dx-diagnostics, an online medical health tracker startup is an application to enable users to measure their health indicators at regular intervals. As an analytics engineer, you'll be designing an Airflow DAG on the cloud to serve as the prototype's backend data architecture. The DAG should calculate the summary statistics of the heart rate and O2 levels of the patient every 15 mins and send a report over a Slack channel. The anomalies in these metrics need to be flagged and saved separately.
